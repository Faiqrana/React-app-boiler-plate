# React app boiler plate

##### This is a boiler plate where we have done some basic configurations

**Some pre-requisits are**
Your IDE must have these extensions installed

* Eslint
* Prettier
###### Things we have configured alredy

* Redux setup
* Eslint setup
* Prettier setup
* Tailwind setup
* Tailwind styled component setup
* Router setup
* Absolute paths

###### Other than basic setup, we have layed the basic foundation of project structure, we must comply to this very setup.

###### Some predefined rules to follow while coding

* Only Arrow functions must be used
* Directory name must start with capital letter
* Files name must start with small letter
* Redux should be only doing state management not api calling
* Must use camal casing in syntax format
* Variable names must be explicit
* No use of custom css or any other frontend framework other than Tailwind
* Never export component or variable as default, you can make exception but stick to the rule
* Instead of using relative paths, we should use absolute paths while importing to avoid ugly looking '../../../../../..'


**Good Luck and remove all Readme.md files after reading**
